# Gimloader

This is a package that provides typed exports for both the scoped and unscoped [Gimloader](https://github.com/TheLazySquid/Gimloader) apis.

## Usage

This needs to be used with a bundler. Use [@gimloader/build](https://npmjs.com/package/@gimloader/build) for a preconfigured one. From there, add `import GL from 'gimloader'` to use the scoped API or `import GL from 'gimloader/global'` to use the unscoped one.
